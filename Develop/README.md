Project Title
E-Commerce Back End

Description
Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.

Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. You’ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the readme of your project.

Installation Instructions
You will need node.js installed

Node.js
Use theMySQL2 NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.
Sequelize packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the
dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.
After creating the models and routes, run npm run seed to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.
Create the code needed in server.js to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start.
To install the required dependencies, please run the following command:

npm i mysql2
npm i sequelizer

Walkthrough Video:
Mock-Up
The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags being tested in Insomnia Core:

In Insomnia Core, the user tests “GET tags,” “GET Categories,” and “GET All Products.”.

The following animation shows the application's GET routes to return a single category, a single product, and a single tag being tested in Insomnia Core:

In Insomnia Core, the user tests “GET tag by id,” “GET Category by ID,” and “GET One Product.”

The following animation shows the application's POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories being tested in Insomnia Core:

In Insomnia Core, the user tests “DELETE Category by ID,” “CREATE Category,” and “UPDATE Category.”

Your walkthrough video should also show the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for products and tags being tested in Insomnia Core.
